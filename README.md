# __Our Project__

We, the So-Called-Engineers have spent the semester developing this project from the ground up using Unity. Our game is a 3D 'platformer' where the user controls a marble and attempts to navigate it to the end of each level. It's worth noting that levels increase in difficulty as the user progresses throughout the game. Feel free to clone this repo and run a build of our project yourself! You will need a working version of Unity to open the project. Below you can find some of the key features of our interactive entertainment experience!


## Insane Graphics

With Unity, we were able to utilize the Asset Store to provide state-of-the-art textures and materials to provide a visually appealing polish to our game. With no graphic designers amongst us, we utilized the community and the various free assets available.


## Top Notch Level Design

With Unity's built-in 3D Scene editor, the team was able to create levels with ease which accommodate for the scaling difficulty we wished to incorporate into our game. You won't find levels this unique in any other game... *we think*


## Amazing Animations

With simple scripting and some particle effects, we were able to create a much less jarring user experience and include fluent animations in our project which enhance the gameplay whenever a user respawns or completes a level.


## Smart Level Select (WIP)

We created a level select screen that allows users to select and replay a level at their own will, but will also keep track of what levels are currently unlocked. You can't skip to the later levels, you have to earn it! This is a work in progress...


Of course, the best way to experience our game is to play it yourself. If you wish to see how it all works, you're in the right place. Explore the repo at length. Feel free to check it out.
