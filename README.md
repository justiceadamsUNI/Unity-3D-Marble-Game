# __Unity-3D-Marble-Game__

This game technically was a school project for software engineering, but I spent a considerable amount of extra time exploring [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and writing scripts using the framework. This project served as an introduction for me into game physics, animation programming, handling character input and so forth. I explored Unity through the use of this project before ultimately deciding to work exclusively in Unreal for various reason. The code is mainly C# and can be found [here](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Unity-3D-Marble-Game/tree/master/Assets/Scripts)! The state it's in now is the state it will stay. I've moved on!

### Here are some screens of the project
